  ## Understanding AI Limitations
  
  While AI can be helpful, it's important to understand what it cannot do and should not replace.
  
  **AI Cannot:**
  * Replace professional mental health treatment
  * Provide medical diagnoses or advice
  * Understand context and nuance like humans
  * Guarantee accuracy in all situations
  
  **Important Reminders:**
  * AI responses are generated based on patterns, not human understanding
  * Always consult qualified professionals for serious mental health concerns
  * AI may occasionally make mistakes or provide inappropriate suggestions
  * Human moderators review AI decisions when needed
  
  :::warning
  Never rely solely on AI for crisis situations. Always seek immediate professional help if you're experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide.
  :::
  
  ## User Control and Consent
  
  You have complete control over how AI interacts with your Xolace experience.

  * AI training does not use your personal content without consent
  * You can request human review of AI decisions
  
  ## AI Safety Measures
  
  We implement multiple safeguards to ensure AI enhances rather than harms your experience.
  
  **Safety Protocols:**
  * Regular auditing of AI systems for bias and accuracy
  * Human oversight of all AI-generated content
  * Strict guidelines for AI behavior in sensitive situations
  * Continuous monitoring and improvement of AI systems
  
  **Crisis Prevention:**
  * AI systems are trained to recognize signs of distress
  * Immediate escalation to human moderators for serious concerns
  * Direct connection to crisis resources when appropriate
  * Never automated responses to crisis situations
  
  **Bias Prevention:**
  We actively work to identify and eliminate bias in our AI systems to ensure fair treatment for all users regardless of background, identity, or circumstances.`,
