      content: `## Campfire Culture
  
  At Xolace, we're building a digital campfire where people gather to share experiences, moments , find warmth, and support each other through life's journeys. 
  These principles keep our fire burning bright: We believe healing begins with empathy, and that means treating one another with respect always. 
  This space was built to make people feel safe opening up, knowing they‚Äôll be met with understanding, not judgment.

**Our Campfire Ethos:**
- **Come as you are**: No performance, no filters, just your authentic self
- **Pass the talking stick**: Listen as much as you speak
- **Tend the flames together**: Support others without judgment (using supportive language, no shaming, no mockery)
- **Leave no trace**: Respect privacy (yours and others')
- Treat all users with dignity and respect regardless of background or belief.
- Assume good intentions, but be mindful of tone.
- Remember: sharing vulnerability is courageous. Honor that trust.

> _Picture Xolace as any physical campfire. Speak to others the way you'd want to be spoken to gently, openly, and with care._
> The most powerful moments happen when we simply say: *"I've been there too."*

- **Shikigami Post Assistant:** Helps you craft thoughtful reflections or responses by weaving your fragments of thought into coherent posts (5 credits per week).  
- **Aniima AI Assistant:** Provides gentle conversation starters and prompts to help you explore your thoughts and feelings (5 credits per week).

    All AI features are clearly labeled. You start each month with a set number of AI credits‚Äîopt in only when you choose.  
  </div>
</div>
  
## Understanding AI Limitations

AI augments, but does not replace, real human connection or professional care.

**What AI Cannot Do:**  
- Diagnose or treat mental health conditions  
- Replace licensed professionals or crisis hotlines  
- Fully grasp context, tone, or cultural nuance  
- Guarantee 100% accuracy or relevance
  
**Key Reminders:**  
- Generated responses are based on learned patterns, not lived experience.  
- Consult qualified professionals for serious or ongoing mental health concerns.  
- AI suggestions may occasionally miss the mark‚Äîyour judgment matters.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <div class="alert-icon">‚ö†Ô∏è</div>
  <div class="alert-content">
    Never rely solely on AI in an emergency. If you or someone else is in crisis, seek immediate help (e.g., call your local hotline).  
  </div>
</div>
  
## User Control and Consent
  
You remain in the driver‚Äôs seat‚ÄîAI is here to assist, not to steer your journey.

**Your AI Settings:**  
- **Enable/Disable:** Turn each AI feature on or off in Settings ‚Üí AI.  
- **Credit Management:** View remaining credits and request additional ones from support if needed.  
  
## AI Safety Measures
  
We uphold rigorous standards to keep AI trustworthy, fair, and secure.
  
**Safety Protocols:**
* Regular auditing of AI systems for bias and accuracy
* Human oversight of all AI-generated content
* Strict guidelines for AI behavior in sensitive situations
* Continuous monitoring and improvement of AI systems
  
  
**Privacy & Bias Prevention:**  
- AI models exclude personal identifiers to preserve anonymity.  
- Continuous retraining to eliminate biased or harmful patterns.  
- User feedback loops to correct and improve AI behavior over time.
